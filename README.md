# AgLandUse
Categories of Agricultural Uses of Global Land Resources  

The objective is to obtain a dataset on agricultural land use which will subsequently be merged with trade and climate datasets.
The goal is to build a model to forecast food production by country which will (hopefully) validate hypotheses regarding:
i) divergences between existing infrastructure investment plans under the EU Green Deal 2050 and real supply/demand imperatives
ii) massive underestimate of future energy due to failure to adequately reflect desertification/loss of arable land for food production

The data is scraped from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup, processed with pandas and visualized with matplotlib/seaborn.
